\section{Future Work}

[TODO: Move this to its own chapter?]

The experiment described here lends itself to future work. It can be easily adapted to use a different set of documents as input. Furthermore, settings may be easily modified to change the number of topics discovered for the LDA topic model, stop word lists, normalization functions, and distance metrics. In particular, an area where this might be particularly interesting and perhaps novel would be to do this on chapters of scripture. Indeed, for those who wish to locate chapters of related content between works of differing religions, one would only need to provide the engine I used here with all chapters from each work as separate documents (e.g. Bible vs. Qur'an, Bible vs. Book of Mormon vs. Doctrine and Covenants, etc.). Perhaps the most interesting combination for the LDS church as a whole would be to perform this on the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price as input, the model could be used to enhance current LDS scriptural footnotes.

I hoped to use the formulas as provided by and described by \cite{Ge:2010:BAE:1864708.1864761}, but Serendipity was not possible for use since no baseline existed. Future work may easily do this by benchmarking against \textit{RelRec}.

\textit{It is important to note that all these works \citep{arora2013practical,arora2012learning} were published after the programming portion of this thesis commenced.} %TODO: move to Conclusion
