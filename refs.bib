  Keywords:
    phase lock loops
    Lyapunov redesign
    stability analysis
  Comments:
    This paper uses Lyapunov analysis to show stability for a simple
                  nonlinear model of phase lock loops with zero noise,
                  step inputs, and 1st and 2nd order low pass
                  filters.  It should be fairly easy to extend this
                  paper to more general low pass filters and also to
                  improve the design using the satisficing approach.

  Comments:
Stabilization by smooth feedback in the neighborhood of an equilibrium
                  point of a control system is considered.  By means
                  of the integral manifold approach we extend this
                  result to a global context.  Then the stabilization
                  of a synchronous generator with speed control, after
                  the occurrence of a symmetric fault is
                  investigated.
