	abstract = {Topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), can be useful tools for the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data. The LDA model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary. A limitation of LDA is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than x-ray astronomy. This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions. In this paper we develop the correlated topic model (CTM), where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution [1]. We derive a mean-field variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multi-nomial. The CTM gives a better fit than LDA on a collection of OCRed articles from the journal Science. Furthermore, the CTM provides a natural way of visualizing and exploring this and other unstructured data

We discuss its connections to probabilistic modeling,and describe two kinds of algorithms for topic discovery. We then survey the growing body of research that extends and applies topic models in interesting ways. These extensions have been developed by relaxing some of the statistical assumptions of LDA, incorporating meta-data into the analysis of the documents, and using similar kinds of models on a diversity of data types such as social networks, images and genetics. Finally, we give our thoughts as to some of the important unexplored directions for topic modeling.

Managers and newcomer developers often seek ways of understanding what tasks have recently been worked on and how much effort has gone into each; for example, a manager might wonder what unexpected tasks occupied their team’s attention during a period when they were supposed to have been implementing a set of new features. Tools such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) can be used to analyze commit log comments over the entire lifetime of a project.Previous work on developer topic analysis has leveraged these tools to associate commit log comments with independent topics extracted from these commit log comments. In this paper, we use LDA to analyze periods, such as months,within a project’s lifetime to create a time-windowed model of changing development topics. We propose visualizations of this model that allows us to explore the evolving stream of topics of development occurring over time. We demonstrate that windowed topic analysis offers advantages over topic analysis applied to a project’s lifetime because many topics are quite local.},

Topic models, which have served as versatile tools for exploratory data analysis and visualization, represent documents as probability distributions over latent topics. Systems comparing topic distributions thus use measures of probability divergence such as Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, or Hellinger. This paper presents novel analysis and applications of the reduction of Hellinger divergence to Euclidean distance computations. This reduction allows us to exploit fast approximate nearest-neighbor (NN) techniques, such as locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and approximate search in k-d trees, for search in the probability simplex. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach on two tasks using latent	Dirichlet allocation (LDA) document representations: discovering	relationships between National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants	and prior-art retrieval for patents. Evaluation on these tasks and on	synthetic data shows that both Euclidean LSH and approximate k-d tree search perform well when a single nearest neighbor must be	found. When a larger set of similar documents is to be retrieved,	the k-d tree approach is more effective and efficient. },

%Can be used to improve search, because it can tag a document with keywords. But since they are binary (present or not), it is ends up being a subset of topic modelling, where the indicator function is a threshold: For each tag, If the document contains more than x% of topic y, then tag it with y. //Otherwise, do not tag it. While this might be sufficient for search, it doesn’t appear to be sufficient for a recommendation.

%Drawbacks: Only a binary system is explored; also, it is a hybrid system, which is a step ahead of what we want. We need a baseline system before we invest more energy into research.
